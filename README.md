# Number guessing game

How it works:

• You have to guess the number that the computer has already guessed.

• If your guess is lower than computer's guess, it will show "Your guess is too low".

• If your guess is higher than computer's guess, it will show "Your guess is too high".

• It also displays how many guesses you have taken.

• If you guessed correctly you will win the game.
